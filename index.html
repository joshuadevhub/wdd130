    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="profile picture for Joshua Elemide Damilare" width="200">

    <p>My name is Joshua Elemide Damilare. I live in Lagos State, Nigeria with my parent and my younger sibling. I'm a
      student of BYU-Pathway Program, learning computer software development.</p>

    <p>While I'm growing keen interest in technology and software development, I also enjoy learning new things,
      spending time with my family, and exploring creative ideas that helps me grow. I recently completed a beginner
      friendly project (Mini Bank Account Using the Basics Of Python), which gave me insight into how coding can solve
      real problems, and I'm happy to continue learning some other aspect of programming which i have started in this
      course WDD130.
    </p>

    <p>I'm still learning and growing as a developer. I'm happy to build more projects in WDD130 using Html and CSS,
      improve my skills, and work with others to create useful things with technology.
